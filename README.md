# MongoDB_Scraper
Program to scrape Data off the internet and insert the data into newly created <Postgres Tables>

Usual Webscrapers get data off the internet and then the user transfers that Data to where they need it. This program skips the middleman and directly creates the Collection and updates the key-value pairs using MongoDB in a Python Program.
